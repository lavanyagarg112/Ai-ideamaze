## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, the ability to brainstorm effectively and explore ideas in depth is invaluable. That's why we created IdeaMaze, an innovative platform powered by artificial intelligence designed to revolutionize the way you think and create. With IdeaMaze, you can delve into any concept by asking questions and following the path of exploration. At any point, you can branch out to generate new ideas, seamlessly weaving them into your brainstorming journey.
